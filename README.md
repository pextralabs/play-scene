# play SCENE

This is an example Play application with a SCENE (`0.10.8-rc1`) engine. It has a simple Entity-Sensor model which can be managed through a RESTFul Api.

The engine deploys a single KnowledgeBase with every DRL declared in `conf/scene/`. It goes with a simple `Fever` situation scenario for the sake of demonstration.

### RESTFul API

**POST** `/entities`

```json
{ 
  "name": "pereirazc",

} 
```
##### ADD SENSOR FOR AN ENTITY
**POST** `/entities/:entityId`
```json

  "label": "temperature",
  "initValue": 36.5
} 
```
##### UPDATE SENSOR VALUE

```json

```

##### WEBSOCKET SUBSCRIPTION
